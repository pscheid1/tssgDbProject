		text: "<p>Hi All. I joined this group the end of October 2018 and went to a few Wednesday meetings in Acton. I had a job at the time with flex hours so I could attend. However, lost that job in mid-December and just started a new one where I am now mostly on-site. As a result I am unable to attend these meetings any more for the foreseeable future. Just wanted to say that I really enjoyed the few I attended, and hope that sometime in the future I will be able to participate again. Wishing you all the best.</p>",

		text: "<p>For each of the TSSG meetings that I attended, it was always encouraging to get together with teams of like-minded professionals and work on a project together. The ability to learn new technology and get hands-on experience with people that were welcoming and knowledgeable was incredibly valuable to my state of mind during my job search.</p>",

		name: "Jim D.",
		text: "<p>I was concerned about being out of work and how that would look on my resume.  One of the interview questions that I was being asked was “What have you been doing since your last position?”.  Yes, Many say that it is OK to say that I have been looking for work.  I didn’t feel good about responding this way.</p> <p>I had heard that volunteering is a better answer but it still didn’t feel like me. I joined the Technical Skill Share Group (TSSG) in 2009.  I had heard about the group from Acton Networkers.   A group that allows you to help others while fine tuning your own skill was my answer.  The group helped me refocus my goal for a new position.  In 2011 I landed at a Health Care Insurance Company as a Project Coordinator.  This is the role I practiced while at TSSG.  I quickly advanced and became a Business Systems Analyst that worked out of the PMO.</p>",

		title: "TSSG Mobile Team Helped Me",
		name: "Shawn F.",
		text: "<p>When I joined the Technical Skills Share Group I had only a basic understanding of Android development but I joined the Mobile group anyhow as that's where my interests lay. I resolved to engage in online education, research and development and dove into the code of the Mobile Group's current Android project to gain understanding and experience. Over time I gained insight and expertise with the help of many TSSG members and due to this I was able to secure a contract position building an Android application from scratch.</p> <p>Although only my first opportunity for employment working on an Android project, I see this as a starting point of many other future opportunities all due to my involvement in TSSG.</p>",
