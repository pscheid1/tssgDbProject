# Geb and Gradle Project

This project was derived from geb/geb-example-gradle.

## Description

The build is setup to work with Firefox and Chrome. Have a look at the `build.gradle` and the `src/test/resources/GebConfig.groovy` files.

These tests will run against the scheduledb branch on https://technologynursery.org/tssgTechScheduledb
Change to kick off build for demo. VM Options for -Dgeb.build.baseUrl are:
* dev or <default>   -> tssgTechScheduledb
* multipage          -> tssgTechMultipage
* qa or stagedMaster -> tssgTechStagedMaster
* webflowqa          -> tssgTechWebflow
* prod or tssgTech   -> tssgTech

These tests will run against the scheduledb branch on local environment: 
* toolbox   --> http://192.168.99.100:7010/  (for docker toolbox on windows)
* localhost --> http://localhost:7010/  (for docker on Linux)

## Database Tests

The mongo database runs in a container.  This database is not
 accessible from the dev and multisite URLs because the 
 container is not exposed to the Internet.  As a result, 
 ensure that the property mongo.host is set to the hostname 
 or IP Address of your locally running mongo database. 
 The default setting for mongo.host is localhost.

### Example setting for gradle parameter:
   * -Dmongo.host=192.168.99.100
   
## Prerequisite
* If running on Windows, must have Git for Windows installed in the default path (https://gitforwindows.org/).  Git Bash is utilized by the xrayImport task.
* If running from Linux, ensure that bash is in the path.

## Usage

The following command will launch the test 
against the default environment 
with the specified browser 
on the selenium grid:

    ./gradlew chromeTest

To run with all, you can run:

    ./gradlew test

Replace `./gradlew` with `gradlew.bat` in the above examples if you are on Windows.

## Options

### Select target test environment

The default url to be tested is the dev endpoint.
To change the baseUrl, set geb.build.baseUrl property to either localhost, toolbox, dev, qa, or prod environments.

To run scheduledb UI tests in the dev environment (currently represents the scheduledb branch on the tssgTechScheduledb endpoint):

    ./gradlew chromeTest --tests TSSGTechSpec -Dgeb.build.baseUrl=dev

To run scheduledb UI tests in the local toolbox docker environment:

    ./gradlew chromeLocalTest --tests TSSGTechSpec -Dgeb.build.baseUrl=toolbox

To run scheduledb UI tests in the local Linux docker environment:

    ./gradlew chromeLocalTest --tests TSSGTechSpec -Dgeb.build.baseUrl=localhost

To run scheduledb UI tests in the qa environment (currently represents the master branch on the tssgTechStagedMaster endpoint):

    ./gradlew chromeTest --tests TSSGTechSpec -Dgeb.build.baseUrl=qa

To run scheduledb UI tests in the prod environment (currently represents the master branch on the production endpoint):

    ./gradlew chromeTest --tests TSSGTechSpec -Dgeb.build.baseUrl=prod

To run scheduledb UI tests in the webflowqa environment (currently represents the webflow branch on the tssgTechWebflow endpoint):

    ./gradlew chromeTest --tests TSSGTechSpec -Dgeb.build.baseUrl=webflowqa

To run scheduledb UI tests in the multipage environment 
(currently represents the multipage branch on the tssgTechMultipage endpoint):

    ./gradlew chromeTest --tests TSSGTechSpec -Dgeb.build.baseUrl=multipage


### To Run Mongo database test

To run tests in the scheduledb branch: ~/Projects/tssgTech/tests/GebAndSpock

    ./gradlew cleanTest test --tests TSSGTechDbSpec
    
### Xray Import

Xray can import the test results of each test.  Make sure to include the Jira testKey in each test.
    
To run xrayImport task, set the jira.username, jira.password System properties for Jira.

    ./gradlew chromeTest \
        xrayImport \
        -Djira.username=navarror \
        -Djira.password=p@ssw0rd

### ReportSnaps

Generate a web page listing screenshots and html for each test:

    ./gradlew chromeTest reportSnaps
    
The reportArtifacts.html page will be placed in build/reports/chromeTest/ containing links to each snapshot and html page.



### To Check test reports

Follow the path below and open the index.html with a browser: 

tssgTech: tests --> GebAndSpock --> build --> reports --> tests --> test --> index.html
